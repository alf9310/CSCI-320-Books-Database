# Project Requirements
For the project:
Users will be able to create new accounts and access via login. The system must record
the date and time an account is created. It must also store the dates and times users
access the application
• Users will be able to create collections of books.
• Users will be to see the list of all their collections by name in ascending order. The list
must show the following information per collection:
    Collections name
    Number of books in the collection
    Total length of the books (in pages) in the collection
    Users will be able to search for books by name, release date, authors, publisher, or
genre. The resulting list of books must show the books name, the authors, the pub-
lisher, the length, audience and the ratings. The list must be sorted alphabetically
(ascending) by books name and release date. Users can sort the resulting list: book
name, publisher, genre, and released year (ascending and descending).
• Users can add and delete books from their collection.
• Users can modify the name of a collection. They can also delete an entire collection
• Users can rate a books (star rating)

book or they can read a random book from a collection. You must record every time
a book is read by a user. You do not need to actually be able to read books, simply
mark them as read.
• Users can follow another user. Users can search for new users to follow by email
